        <h1>Facts</h1>
        <p><b>Macquarie Island</b> is an interesting place, might I say. It has some of the wackiest history I've ever seen. Not just on islands, but <i>EVER</i>. History isn't even the most iconic part of the island! Okay, maybe it is, but my statement still stands valid!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>Macquarie Island lies <b>1,500 kilometers</b> to the south-east of Tasmania, placing it approximately halfway through Australia and Antartica. Macquarie Island has a personal milestone of being <b>34 kilometers long!</b> That's small compared to countries, but this is bigger than the trip from Gulgong to Mudgee! Actually, that sounds really short. But still! Macquarie Island is 5.5 kilometers wide, meaning that Macquarie Island is <b>187000kmÂ²</b> in area!</p>
        <p>For comparison, the Eiffel Tower is 330 meters tall. You'd need 1.2 Eiffel Towers to be the same height as Macquarie Island. It's <b>410 meters tall</b>, Macquarie Island. You know that colosseum in Rome? It's <i>very very</i> short! You'd need <b>~12 colosseums</b> to surpass Macquarie Island's height!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Geology</h2>
        <p>The Geology of Macquarie Island is <i>insane!</i> It's one of the <b>most unique</b> islands that I've <i>ever</i> seen! I haven't seen that many islands, because I've only seen famous ones. The only reason for an island to go famous, is if it has a unique structural integrity.</p>
        <p>It's the only island to have mantle developed from below Earth's crust shown above Earth's surface, further adding to its uniqueness. Just to let you know, mantle is 6 kilometers- <b>SIX</b>; below Earth's crust.</p>
