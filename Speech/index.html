        <h1>Transcript</h1>
        <p>This is the transcript (script) of my speech! This is the speech that involves Macquarie Island.</p>
        <p>Mac. I = Macquarie Island</p>
        <p>Mac. Q = Macquarie Island</p>
        <p>Aus = Australian</p>
        <p>Tas = Tasmanian</p>
        <p>Governm = Government</p>
        <p>U = You</p>
        <p>T. Plates = Tectonic Plates</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 1</h2>
        <p>What is Mac. I? Mac. I is a brilliant island owned by no one. Technically it's owned by the Aus Governm, but my argument still stands valid! Recently, (like a century ago), the island has had a multitude of issues involving invasive species. Over the span of this presentation, we'll be entering the timeline, exploring the problems AND discovering the solutions that U- can solve! The following timeline starts waaaay back in 30M BC- back when Mr J was born!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 2</h2>
        <p>1. Macquarie Island was formed of oceanic crust 6KM below the ocean floor. 2. Mantle crust pushed up rocks like toothpaste. 3. Feral species were introduced to Mac. I by whalers and sealers. 4. The Aus Governm planned to eradicate feral species. 5. Rabbits haven't been seen ever since the July of 2011.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 3</h2>
        <h3>30M BC</h3>
        <p>'What happened 30M years ago?' you may ask. Well, Macquarie Island started as oceanic crust 6km below the ocean ground. What is oceanic crust? It's basically just dense, but thin basalt.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 4</h2>
        <h3>Next Slide</h3>
        <p>Coincidentally, Mac Q was inbetween 2 tectonic plates. If you know anything about them, you'd know that they formed every single bit of land on Earth. The T. Plates pushed off eachother, allowing mantle to escape. Mantle is a thick and dense material found below Earth's crust.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 5</h2>
        <h3>600k BC - 1810</h3>
        <p>All the mantle from about 10M years ago stopped spreading. The crust from T. Plates eventually compressed and harden, pushing up mantle like toothpaste.</p>
        <p>Throughout 600K BC, water processes like waves carved the edges of the surface mantle, forming Mac. Q!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 6</h2>
        <p>What kind of water processes? I just told you!- Waves! Besides that, Islands aren't <i>normally</i> formed by waves.</p>
        <p>Instead, Islands are carved by giant glaciers hitting the edges of the island.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 7</h2>
        <h3>1810 - 1899</h3>
        <p>In 1810, a Aus fisher by the name of Frederick Hasselberg discovered Mac. Q- on accident.</p>
        <p>He had an original route, aiming towards Campbell Island. Frederick was a sealer, which is a job that skins and kills seals.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 8</h2>
        <p>Him and his sealer gange had intentions to arrive at Campbell Island because seals lived there.</p>
        <h3>NEXT SLIDE</h3>
        <p>What do they do to the seals? LIKE I SAID before... they skin seals. Now, the governm left the sealers on the island, stranded.</p>
        <p>Seals were sorta the only food source besides penguins.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 9</h2>
        <h3>1810 - 1899</h3>
        <p>WHAT DID THEY DO TO THE PENGUINS?! Not to blame the whalers and sealers, but the penguins (including babies) were pushed into hot, boiling pots for food!</p>
        <p>The government stranded sealers and whalers on an isolated island. What did you expect them to do? Let themselves starve? NEXT SLIDE.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 10</h2>
        <h3>1810 - 1899</h3>
        <p>In the early 1870's, help finally arrived. A ship big enough to fit a the stranded people, along with their resources.</p>
        <p>There was 1 small issue with that, and that, was feral animals. They were released to Mac. Q to slaughter the native animals. No remorse included.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Plam Card 11</h2>
        <h3>2000 - 2011</h3>
        <p>Next Slide</p>
        <p>2 infamous Mac. Q species have gone extince! I wonder how... Enough about that. In 2000, The Aus Governm decided enough was enough.</p>
        <p>They sent professional pest controllers to Mac. Q to eradicate feral cats. This plan succeeded the very same year.</p>
        <h3>Next Slide</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 12</h2>
        <h3>2000 - 2011</h3>
        <p>In the June of 2007, both the Tas Governm and the Aus Governm put a total of $24.6m into eradicating all pests on Mac. Q.</p>
        <p>Later, in the winter of 2010, rat bait was spread all across the island by a helicopter. This'd continue until the winter of 2011, stopped due to bad weather.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 13</h2>
        <h3>2011 - 2014</h3>
        <p>The Aus Governm sent more people to Mac. Q, this time to exterminate remaining pests left from the poison rain.</p>
        <p>These people used professionally trained dogs to seek out hiding rabbits.</p>
        <h3>NEXT SLIDE</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 14</h2>
        <h3>2011 - 2014</h3>
        <p>In 2013, the Aus Governm sent a helicopter back to Mac. Q. That way, the few people on Mac. Q could return to Aus.</p>
        <p>On that helicopter, 3 professionally trained dogs were sent out onto the island alone, just to make sure 0 rabbits could be found.</p>
        <h3>NEXT SLIDE</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Palm Card 15</h2>
        <h3>2025</h3>
        <p>In summary? The eradication of the Mac. Q parakeet was a mistake that the sealers and whalers never thought of- yes I'm sure of it.</p>
        <p>But- why am I here telling you today? Why even make this presentation?</p>
        <h2>Palm Card 16</h2>
        <h3>2025</h3>
        <p>Why is this island being protected to this day- WHY THIS island specifically? There's many other islands at a horrible condition!</p>
        <p>Well, this island is territory owned by the Aus Governm. They don't want anything awful like that to happen EVER again.</p>
        <h3>NEXT SLIDE x 3</h3>
